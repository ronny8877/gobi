## What is Gobi?

Gobi is a simple mock server that can be used to mock APIs. It is designed to be simple to use and easy to configure.
It is written in Go and is easy to Use and run.
<br/>
The Mock data is powred by [Faker](https://github.com/jaswdr/faker), and Offers a wide range of mock data.

<br/>
## Getting Started

To get started with Gobi, you can download the binary and build it from source.
After that you can start just by running the binary.

> **_NOTE:_**  You'll need to have a configuration file in the same directory as the binary. The configuration file is a simple JSON file that contains the routes and the responses that you want to mock and other server related configurations.

<br/>

``` json title="input.json"
{
    "config":{},
    "api":[]
}
```
This will be the minimum configuration file that you need to have to run the server. The file should be named `input.json` and should be in the same directory as the binary.
